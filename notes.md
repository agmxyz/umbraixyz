Umbrai: Addressing LLM Privacy Risks (Insights from EDPB)(https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2025-04/ai-privacy-risks-and-mitigations-in-llms.pdf)
The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) document "AI Privacy Risks and Mitigations in LLMs" (April 2025) provides crucial insights into the privacy challenges posed by Large Language Models (LLMs) and outlines key mitigation strategies. Umbrai, as an on-device data anonymization proxy, is uniquely positioned to directly address many of these concerns, offering a practical and effective solution for Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) in the EU.

I. Key Privacy Risks in LLMs (According to EDPB)
The EDPB report highlights several critical privacy risks inherent in the use of LLMs, especially relevant for organizations processing personal data:

Input Data Risks:

Inadvertent Disclosure of Sensitive Data: Users, either intentionally or unintentionally, might input personal or sensitive corporate data into LLMs, which are often processed by third-party cloud services. This data could then be stored, logged, or even used for model training, leading to unintended disclosure.

Over-Collection of Data: LLM providers may collect more personal data (e.g., interaction logs, prompts, user IDs) than is strictly necessary for the service, violating data minimization principles.

Output Data Risks:

Memorization and Regeneration: LLMs can memorize parts of their training data, including personal data, and later regenerate it in response to user queries, potentially exposing private information to unauthorized parties.

Inference and Linkage Attacks: Even if direct identifiers are not disclosed, LLMs can infer personal data from seemingly non-identifying information or be used to link disparate pieces of data to re-identify individuals.

Hallucinations/Fabrications of Personal Data: LLMs can generate plausible but false information, including fabricated personal data, leading to misinformation about individuals.

Training Data Risks:

Unlawful Processing of Training Data: Personal data might be included in training datasets without a valid legal basis (e.g., consent) or without proper anonymization/pseudonymization, leading to compliance issues.

Bias and Discrimination: Biases present in training data can lead to discriminatory outputs from LLMs, impacting individuals unfairly.

Security Risks:

Prompt Injection Attacks: Malicious actors could inject prompts designed to extract sensitive information or manipulate the LLM's behavior.

Vulnerability to Data Exfiltration: The architectural design of some LLM services might create pathways for sensitive data to be exfiltrated.

II. Key Mitigations Recommended by EDPB
The EDPB proposes various mitigations, broadly categorizing them into organizational, technical, and legal measures. For an on-device proxy, the most relevant technical mitigations include:

Data Minimization: Collecting and processing only the data strictly necessary for a given purpose.

Anonymization and Pseudonymization: Implementing robust techniques to transform personal data so it cannot be linked back to individuals or requires significant effort to do so.

Access Controls and Data Segregation: Limiting access to sensitive data and keeping it separate from non-sensitive data.

Transparency and Explainability: Ensuring data subjects are informed about how their data is processed and allowing for understanding of LLM decisions.

Security Measures: Implementing robust cybersecurity controls (e.g., encryption, incident response).

Privacy by Design and by Default: Building privacy protections into systems from the ground up.

III. How Umbrai Addresses LLM Privacy Issues
Umbrai, as an on-device data anonymization proxy, directly addresses many of the EDPB's identified risks and aligns with its recommended mitigations, particularly concerning input data privacy and data minimization at the source.

Mitigating Input Data Risks (Inadvertent Disclosure & Over-Collection):

On-Device Interception: Umbrai's core function is to intercept all outgoing text data from user applications (like web browsers accessing LLMs) before it leaves the user's machine. This means sensitive personal or proprietary information in prompts never reaches the LLM provider's cloud servers in its original, identifiable form.

Automated Anonymization/Pseudonymization: Umbrai automatically detects and transforms sensitive data (PII, PHI, financial data, custom keywords) in real-time. This ensures that the data actually transmitted to the LLM is either permanently anonymized or pseudonymized using tokens that cannot be re-identified by the LLM provider. This directly implements data minimization at the point of origin.

Redaction/Masking Options: Users can configure Umbrai to redact sensitive parts entirely or mask them with placeholders, significantly reducing the "over-collection" risk by preventing unnecessary sensitive data from being processed by the LLM.

Addressing Output Data Risks (Memorization & Inference):

While Umbrai primarily focuses on input data, by ensuring that no identifiable personal data is submitted to the LLM for processing, it drastically reduces the risk of the LLM memorizing or regenerating sensitive information. If the LLM never receives the personal data, it cannot store or reproduce it.

By submitting only anonymized data, Umbrai also limits the LLM's ability to infer personal data through linkage attacks, as the source identifiers are already removed or replaced.

Supporting Training Data & Security Risks:

Indirect Impact on Training Data: If LLM providers use user inputs for training, Umbrai ensures that any data they receive from Umbrai users is already anonymized. This contributes to better privacy practices by potentially minimizing the amount of personal data inadvertently included in future training datasets.

Reduced Prompt Injection Attack Surface: While not a full cybersecurity solution, by anonymizing specific entities within a prompt, Umbrai could potentially make it harder for certain types of sophisticated prompt injection attacks that rely on specific personal data patterns or structures.

Enhancing Privacy by Design: Umbrai embodies the "Privacy by Design" principle by embedding data protection into the very flow of user interaction with LLMs. It shifts the responsibility of anonymization to the user's controlled environment, rather than relying solely on the LLM provider's backend mitigations.

IV. Umbrai's Operational Flow for LLM Privacy
User Inputs Prompt: An SMB employee types a query into a web-based or desktop LLM interface (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, Claude). This prompt might inadvertently contain client names, project details, or internal financial figures.

Umbrai Intercepts (On-Device): The Umbrai desktop application, running silently in the background, intercepts this outgoing text data locally, before it leaves the user's machine.

Real-time Anonymization: Umbrai's detection engine identifies sensitive entities (PII, PHI, financial data, custom keywords) based on the user's configured privacy rules. It then applies the chosen anonymization technique (e.g., masking names with [PERSON_NAME_MASKED], redacting account numbers, pseudonymizing client IDs).

Anonymized Data Transmitted: Only the anonymized version of the prompt is sent over the internet to the LLM provider's servers.

LLM Processes Anonymized Data: The LLM receives and processes the query, generating a response based on the anonymized input. The LLM provider never sees the original sensitive data.

Response Received: The LLM's response is delivered back to the user, who interacts with it as normal, knowing their sensitive data was protected at the source.

Local Audit Trail: Umbrai maintains a local, user-accessible audit log (without storing the actual sensitive data) confirming when anonymization occurred, providing a record for compliance purposes.

By implementing this on-device workflow, Umbrai offers c a proactive, user-centric solution to navigate the complex privacy landscape of LLMs, allowing them to harness AI's power while adhering to strict EU data protection mandates
